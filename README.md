# HDB Resale Price Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis of Housing & Development Board (HDB) resale prices in Singapore from January 2017 to January 2024. The analysis identifies key trends, explores factors affecting resale prices, and offers insights that can guide market predictions.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:
- Analyze trends in HDB resale prices over the given period.
- Identify how different factors like town, flat type, and remaining lease affect resale prices.
- Provide insights and forecast potential future movements in resale prices.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: Used for data processing, analysis, and visualization. The project leverages Excel's capabilities to create interactive dashboards and visual representations of the data.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Period**: January 2017 to January 2024.
- **Columns**:
  - `month`: The month of the transaction.
  - `town`: The town where the flat is located.
  - `flat_type`: The type of HDB flat (e.g., 3-room, 4-room).
  - `block`: The block number of the flat.
  - `street_name`: The street on which the flat is located.
  - `storey_range`: The range of storeys on which the flat is located.
  - `floor_area_sqm`: The floor area of the flat in square meters.
  - `flat_model`: The model of the flat.
  - `lease_commence_date`: The year when the lease commenced.
  - `remaining_lease`: The remaining lease period at the time of resale.
  - `resale_price`: The price at which the flat was resold.

## Analysis & Findings
- **Steady Increase in Resale Prices**: Over the period analyzed, there has been a noticeable upward trend in resale prices, reflecting increased demand and market growth.
- **Influence of Flat Type and Town**: Larger flat types (e.g., 4-room, 5-room) and flats in certain towns have experienced more significant price increases.
- **Importance of Remaining Lease**: The remaining lease period of the flat is a critical factor influencing its resale price, with shorter remaining leases generally leading to lower prices.

## File Structure
- **Dashboard Sheet**: Interactive visualizations summarizing key trends and insights from the data.
- **control Sheet**: Parameters and controls for interacting with the dashboard.
- **Data Sheet**: Aggregated and processed data summarizing average prices and sales counts by various dimensions.
- **FullData Sheet**: Raw dataset containing detailed records of individual resale transactions.

## How to Use
- **Explore the Dashboard**: Open the `HDB Resale Price Analysis.xlsx` file and navigate to the Dashboard sheet to explore the visualized trends and insights.
- **Interact with the Data**: Use the controls provided in the `control` sheet to filter and drill down into specific aspects of the data.

## Future Work
- **Enhancing Predictive Models**: Future work could involve developing predictive models to forecast future HDB resale prices using machine learning techniques.
- **Expanding Analysis**: The analysis could be expanded to include other factors like proximity to MRT stations, schools, or shopping centers.
